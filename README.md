# Short_Project_TextProcessing
A basic text processing program built using Python

I've created this program using an Object Oriented Approach wherein I calculated the total number of words, total number of unique words, 
creating word count, saving a dictionary to a json file, removing all the whitespaces, special characters from the file and saving the file as new.

## Breakdown of the program:
- reading a text file.
- counting the total number of unique words from the text file. 
- counting the total number of words from the text file. 
- creating a dictionary showing the word with its count(occurence) in the text file.
- saving the above dictionary into a json file.
- converting all the words into lowercase and again creating a dictionary with the words and its count and saving it into a json file.
- removing all the whitespaces from the text file.
- removing all the special characters from the text file.
- saving the newly formed file
